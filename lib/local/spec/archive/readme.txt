Once upon a time I planned on writing a package for dlsh
that would do all the spectral analyses that we did in the
matlab world, but given this and that it never happened.
What you have here are the remnants and snippets of this on and
off again effort. There may be a line or two of use to someone, but
they should be tested thoroughly. Unfortunately, as with many half
finished projects, there is essentially no good documentation.
